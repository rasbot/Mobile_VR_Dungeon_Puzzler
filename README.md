Using the Unity game engine this project is a mobile VR game where the player solves a Simon Says like puzzle. Using a Google cardboard headset while running the game on an Android smart phone, the user can look around in 3 rotational degrees of freedom. They can look left / right, up / down, and tilt their head. The button on the cardboard headset gives the player the ability to interact with the environment by looking at an object and clicking. This gives the user the ability to move into the dungeon, as well as click on the puzzle to play the game. 

### The Puzzle

The puzzle is similar to Simon Says. There are 5 orbs within the dungeon. The player watches the orbs glow in a particular order, and must click on the orbs in the same order. If unsuccessful, they must try again. Doom awaits the player unable to complete the 5 levels of orb clicking!

The player must navigate through the maze and can encounter spooky areas of the maze. Is this a previous player? Is there peril and danger around every corner?

### The Beginning

When the player awakes, they are in a dark and foreboding world. They are greeted with a sign, informing them that they are in the dreaded puzzle dungeon.

Many travelers have not returned from this unforgiving land. As they stand outside of this dungeon, a sinister sky filled with countless stars greets them. The desolate mountain range engulfs them in a sense of isolation.

### The Dungeon

Upon entering the dungeon, the terror builds as the floating orbs command the player to copy their pattern. How are they floating? Where did they even come from? The task at hand slowly becomes more important than finding answers to these questions.

For each level passed, the player will be able to start the next section. Beware as there are dangers that lurk beyond the dungeon walls.

If the player is diligent, the dungeon can be conquered, and the player lives to tell the tale.

What will await the winner? Nothing? Perhaps the developer did not account for this and the player must keep cycling through the dungeon, only to find themselves at the start of the game each time. Will the cycle ever end? Does the developer intend to revisit this project, perhaps transporting the player out of this hellish landscape when the game is completed? Or did they move on to more interesting projects, abandoning the player...entombing them within the aging walls of this puzzle dungeon? These answers are yet unknown, and perhaps will never be uncovered.
